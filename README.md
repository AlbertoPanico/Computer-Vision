This project contains 3 basic folder (Face_Mesh, 
Hand_tracking and Pose_Estimation) with the logic
and one project folder.

Every folder contains 3 files: the first with all the code,
in the second I've created the module and in the third one 
there are a simple runnable code you can try.

In the project's folder there are the file `VolumeHandControl.py` that allows you
to control the volume of your pc with a simple gesture thanks to the module 
we have created before `HandTrackingModule.py`
